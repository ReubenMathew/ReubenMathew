# User Guide for Collaborating with Me
Useful information related to the way I work and how we can collaborate better.

### Processes/Rituals
- My core hours for meetings are 8AM-4PM EST
- I often have deep work sessions that last between 2-4 hours per session
    - Usually I have at least one session and no more than two sessions per day
- I maintain a daily worklog whose entries chronicle events, future deliverables and accomplishments of the day

### Code Reviews
- I use üëÄ to acknowledge that I have seen a comment on a submitted pull request
- I use üëç to acknowledge that I have accepted and implemented a suggestion with an already (or soon to be) pushed commit
- I start reviewing pull requests around 4-5pm EST

### Communication
- I check Slack and my corporate email (reuben@nats.io) in between deep work sessions
- If I am directly pinged in Slack I respond as soon as I see the notification
- [Please don't just say hello](https://no-hello.com)

### Misc.
- I prefer a combo of Google Docs tables and dropdown pills over a JIRA board
- I like smaller teams
- I use Vim btw (unless I'm writing Java)

No, that is not the rabbit from Donnie Darko. It's a Kangaroo.
