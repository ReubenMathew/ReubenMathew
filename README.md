# Guide for Collaborating with Me
Useful information related to the way I work and how we can collaborate better.

### Code Reviews
- I use 👀 to acknowledge that I have seen a comment on a submitted pull request
- I use 👍 to acknowledge that I have accepted and implemented a suggestion with an already (or soon to be) pushed commit
- I start reviewing pull requests around 4-5pm EST

### Communication
- I check my community email (reuben@nats.io) regularly 
- If I am directly pinged in Slack I respond as soon as I see the notification
- [Please don't just say hello](https://no-hello.com)

No, that is not the rabbit from Donnie Darko. It's a Kangaroo.
